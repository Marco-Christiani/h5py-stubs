# `h5py-stubs`

Type stubs for the python package `h5py`.

Do note that this repository was mainly for personal use and so it is not designed with outside use in mind.

It should satisfy type checkers on the API level however the type hints may not be entirely accurate.

## Installation

I have not tested installation on anything other than `uv`'s git repository packages feature,
but anyway to install a python package that supports GitHub repositories should work.

There is currently not a pypi package set up.

## Contributing

I am open to taking in pull requests.
